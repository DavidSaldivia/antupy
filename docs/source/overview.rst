The `antupy` variable system
=============================
`antupy` works in its core with a Unit management module `units`, which include the class `Unit` compatible with the SI unit system. From this, three type of variables are possible. The `Var` class to manage single variables in the form of `(value:float, unit:str)` structure. The `Array` class for structures in the form of `(array:np.ndarray, unit:str)` and the `DataFrame` class for 2D-structures such as `(frame: pd.DataFrame|pl.DataFrame, unit:str)`.
