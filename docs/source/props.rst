The ``props`` module
========================
The ``props`` module in `antupy` provides a library of thermophysical properties for various fluids and materials. For all materials it allows users to easily access and utilize properties such as density, specific heat, and thermal conductivity. For fluids, specifically, it also includes properties like viscosity, enthalpy, etc.

The most essential fluids like ``Water``, ``Air``, ``Steam``, and ``CO2`` are included, along with a few others.
