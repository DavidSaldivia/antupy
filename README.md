# antupy
antupy (pronounced *antu-py*[^1], from the mapudungún word "antu" (sun)[^2]). It is an open-source python library to analyse thermal energy systems using stochastics methods.


[^1]: IPA pronunciation.
[^2]: mapudungún is the language of the Mapuche people, the main indigineous group in Chile. antü means sun, which also represents one of the main pilláns (spirits) in Mapuche mythology. Here the word is used with its first literal meaning. The name was chosen because the first version of this library was written in Temuco, a Chilean city located at Mapuche heartland (*Wallmapu*). More importantly, this library does not claim to include any of the Mapuche worldview in its development. I am Chilean (*huinca* from a mapuche point of view), but I do support Mapuche people's claims regarding their autonomy, lands, and self-determination.
