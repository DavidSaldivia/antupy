	abstract = {Some of the existing natural gas pipelines in Chile are underutilized; thus, these reservoirs could be utilized as Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) systems taking advantages of ﬂuctuations in the price of electricity related to the entrance of renewable energy sources in the electrical market. A thermodynamic and economic-optimization of CAES system using existing gas pipelines under different operating conditions is performed. Substations located in the proximity to existing gas pipelines are assessed as possible CAES locations. Throughout the day, the CAES system compresses air, charges the pipeline by buying energy during low prices, and expands the air, discharging the pipeline by selling energy when prices are high. One of the Northern substations (Taltal) shows the best results where more of the photovoltaic power plant are located; consequently, CAES is more proﬁtable when high difference in marginal cost is present along the day, which happens on grids with high renewable share. Therefore, the daily variations of marginal costs should be a key parameter decision to operate the CAES plant. With higher marginal costs ﬂuctuations throughout the day, CAES systems should become more attractive economically.},

	abstract = {Advanced power cycles—such as the supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) cycle—have the potential to reduce the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of concentrated solar thermal power (CST) plants by significantly boosting their overall solar-to-electric efficiency. To successfully integrate these cycles into CST plants, the industry may need to transition away from liquid working fluids (e.g., synthetic oils and molten salts) to solid and/or gaseous heat transfer media, which are more stable at high temperatures. To address this challenge, this study investigates a novel rotating receiver–storage unit that could enable high-temperature CST plants. A validated numerical model is presented for the charging and discharging processes of the proposed design. It was found that with cast steel as the storage medium in the proposed design, it is possible to achieve {\textgreater}70\% receiver efficiency for operation temperatures of 850–1000 K. The overall plant model shows this design is best for relatively small CST systems as modularized units of 10 m diameter (reaching an energy density around 80 kWh/m3), which can be used to drive a 5 MWe sCO2 CST plant. These findings suggest that such a design would have up to 9 h of storage and could be effectively employed as an efficient peaking plant.},

	abstract = {Next generation CST plants need to move towards higher operation temperatures and advanced cycles to obtain higher thermodynamic efficiency. Beam-down receivers (BDRs) can unlock higher operation temperatures via ground-mounted receivers which use solid and gas-phase heat transfer media—as opposed to nitrate salts, which have a {\textless}600 °C limit—and avoid the pumping requirements of a conventional tower-mounted receiver. This work presents a novel method to study the optics of BDRs, which is then applied to the most promising optical design. The flux distribution in both the secondary optical element (i.e., a hyperboloid mirror in the present study) and tertiary optical element (i.e., a polygonal CPC array in the present study) were obtained to calculate their optical efficiencies for a wide range of potential geometric designs. It was found that the main limitations on geometry were the hyperboloid height and the CPC’s concentration ratio. In addition, it was found that this technology is a good option for small towers (around 50 m height) and for small, modular receivers (i.e., ∼30 MWth), noting that multiple receivers could serve a central power block. For this size, a BDR’s optical efficiency of 82.3\% is obtained. It was also found that this BDR module (i.e., including both the hyperboloid and the CPC array) represents only a 2.56\% (1358 m2) increase of total plant mirror area as compared to tower mounted receiver. Lastly, this design was estimated to provide overall (sun-to-electricity) efficiency of 20.3\% using a sCO2 power cycle, which is comparable to conventional CST plants but with potential lower costs.},

	abstract = {Domestic electric water heating (DEWH) is one of the most energy-consuming applications in modern households worldwide. Two of the most common technologies are hot water storage tanks with resistive heaters and heat pumps. This study evaluates the thermal behavior of hot water tanks under different heating control strategies, hot water draw profiles and technologies. A novel approach is presented using an integrated Python/TRANSYS framework to perform annual thermal simulations for two types of heaters: resistive and heat pumps. The results show that the DEWH tank storage efficiency is affected more by the control strategy than the household behavior, with average annual efficiencies between 65 and 70 \%. The best performance control strategies are the “nighttime” controlled load, and a solar soak (SS) timer. The results were extended across different Australian cities to capture the impact of different climate variables. Regarding the technologies, moving from resistive heaters to heat pumps can reduce emissions up to 67 \%, while using a solar soak timer can decrease emissions between 3 \%–19 \% in different Australian capital cities with different renewable energy penetrations in the electricity mix.},

	abstract = {This study presents a numerical model for a multi-effect distillation (MED) plant driven by solar energy. The model is based on mass, energy, and heat transfer equations applicable to the coupled MED and steam generation plants. The MED plant model has been validated with experimental data from the multi-effect distillation plant of the Plataforma Solar de Almería (PSA) in Spain [1]. Additionally, the model of the solar steam generation plant is validated using experimental data acquired from the parabolic trough collector (PTC) at the SANDIA National Laboratory, USA [2]. Both validations show good agreement between model and measurements, with a relative error smaller than 3\%. Additionally, the heat transfer processes that occur in evaporators and preheaters are studied herein, and several heat transfer correlations are tested. The heat transfer model used in evaporators appears to be a key factor for performance predictions and may require further studies. Finally, the validated model is used to assess the technical feasibility of the installation of a solar MED plant in Valparaíso, Chile. The main results are analyzed under variable weather conditions. In addition, the MED plant is evaluated in different Chilean cities, and a linear dependence between fresh water production and solar radiation is established. In conclusion, a powerful computational tool is developed that may be useful for the design, optimization, and assessment of the technical feasibility of installation of future solar MED plants.},
