	abstract = {This study consolidates the literature relating to the systematic bias of model-derived irradiance data and further characterises the same for ERA-5 and MERRA-2, two reanalysis datasets that are frequently used to model renewable power in energy system modelling studies. The bias errors yielded when modelling Solar PV generation for solar parks in Australia and Northern Ireland are compared under the optics of typically clear versus typically cloudy respective climates. Evidence is presented that MERRA-2 exhibits a significant global overestimation bias, contrary to some literature that suggests local variation and underestimation in some locations. Based on the trends identified, it is proposed that overestimation bias proliferates in more cloudy climates for both reanalysis datasets. The implications of such bias for studies involving long-duration energy storage with low round-trip efficiency are investigated and an unfortunate mechanism for error propagation is highlighted. A simplified power system consisting of wind, solar, and energy storage is modelled to demonstrate this effect with solar power profiles derived from metered generation, ERA-5, and MERRA-2. It shown that greater systematic bias of MERRA-2, in combination with the opportunity for error propagation through low-round trip efficiency, has the potential to significantly distort the charging \& discharging pattern, overall utilization, and total energy requirement of long duration energy storage infrastructure. ERA-5, despite also exhibiting systematic bias, was better able to reproduce the simulated results of the metered generation scenario. Finally, it is recommended that energy modellers using MERRA-2 data to simulate solar PV outputs should now migrate to ERA-5 if reanalysis data is to be used.},

The model is intended to bridge the gap between the single coefficient of performance parameter currently used in the UK procedures for the assessment of the energy efficiency of dwellings and the dynamic simulation models frequently developed for the academic estimation of heat pump energy use. It is responsive to variations in source and sink temperatures whilst being simple enough to be embedded in a spreadsheet model. The model was developed by: building a regression model, using heat pump performance test results, relating heat pump coefficient of performance to the differential between source and sink temperatures – “lift”; deriving estimating rules for monthly supply temperature estimates for commonly-used heat pump sources and for demand temperatures for normal wet central heating sinks to give a monthly estimate for the source/sink differential; embedding the regression model in the UK standard model for domestic energy estimation, with additional routines to estimate energy consumption for additional heat and for space cooling. The model developed was validated by comparison with the existing BREDEM model. Compared with the standard BREDEM estimates, the resulting model showed correct response to changes in ambient temperatures, allowing correct estimating of consumption for additional heat under conditions of climate change. It showed variation of heat pump coefficient of performance across the year, allowing better estimation of winter peak load.},

As such, understanding its drivers and forecasting domestic hot water and associated energy consumption are of paramount importance for decision making from the individual household level to a national, or even international, sustainability policy level. However, detailed end-use measurements of either energy or water are seldom available and large scale (city, region or country) estimates are often done based on annual average values. The present research effort aims at large scale estimation of the energy use and carbon emissions due to domestic hot water consumption in two, predominantly residential, locations in a touristic region in Portugal. A novel dynamic modelling approach is proposed and used, which accounts for the variability of: i) the cold water temperature based on measured data; ii) the total amount of water consumed based on measured data; and iii) the fraction of the water consumed as domestic hot water corrected by the air temperature. The results are compared with alternative modelling approaches of the same degree of complexity, revealing differences ranging between −18\% and +11\% in both net energy required to produce the domestic hot water and the corresponding carbon emissions. Differences in the results are found to exist not only due to the modelling approach, but also between the locations, highlighting the importance of both the simulation approach and the particularities of the context being captured.},

The tool applies heuristic vehicle scheduling to existing public General Transit Feed Specification data to model the charging profiles and electricity consumption of BEPT for various charging regimes across different geographical scales. For the case study of New South Wales, Australia, the impacts of BEPT are most significant at the low-voltage network, where adding a battery-electric bus depot was found to increase the annual critical peak demand at the local zone substation in Summer by up to 17\% while exacerbating demand during the daily evening peak period by 20–30\%.

We consider both supply and demand side measures. In addition to presenting energy system flexibility measures, their importance to renewable electricity is discussed. The flexibility measures available range from traditional ones such as grid extension or pumped hydro storage to more advanced strategies such as demand side management and demand side linked approaches, e.g. the use of electric vehicles for storing excess electricity, but also providing grid support services. Advanced batteries may offer new solutions in the future, though the high costs associated with batteries may restrict their use to smaller scale applications. Different “P2Y”-type of strategies, where P stands for surplus renewable power and Y for the energy form or energy service to which this excess in converted to, e.g. thermal energy, hydrogen, gas or mobility are receiving much attention as potential flexibility solutions, making use of the energy system as a whole. To “functionalize” or to assess the value of the various energy system flexibility measures, these need often be put into an electricity/energy market or utility service context. Summarizing, the outlook for managing large amounts of RE power in terms of options available seems to be promising.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a systematic review of 34 large-scale projects of power-to-heat demand response. The projects have been classified in terms of location, size, technical implementation and objective. The chronological ordering of the reviewed projects enables key takeaways to be drawn considering other developments in the energy sector, such as its restructuring and the emergence of competing flexibility options. The presented approach provides renewed insight to the debate on power-to-heat demand response diffusion. Historically, power-to-heat demand response has been used because of its wide availability on the demand side. Within utility programs, it has mostly been used to deal with infrastructure capacity limitations. This is still a major driver for power-to-heat demand response today. To address the challenges that come with the integration of renewable energy sources, more recent research projects have focused on exploring its capability to provide real-time balancing and frequency response at a smaller scale. The literature review suggests that the period of energy sector restructuring introduced uncertainty to energy companies regarding power-to-heat demand response and thus influenced its use. This period is now superseded by developments focused on electricity markets that are open to the demand side. Considering the flexibility requirement of the future energy system, new opportunities arise for power-to-heat demand response. Based on a critical analysis of the technical and regulatory changes, this paper makes the claim that the economic and policy frameworks have had a much more significant effect on the varying diffusion of power-to-heat demand response than the effect of the control and information technologies. In that sense, market rules should be carefully tailored so as to unlock the flexibility not only of power-to-heat demand response, but also of other flexibility resources.},

	abstract = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) are a rapidly growing technology which can lower greenhouse-gas emissions in the transport and energy sectors. The EV batteries can discharge the stored energy back to grid, also known as Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) which can support the integration of variable distributed renewable generation. Previous research identified financial barriers to the implementation of V2G, however, recent advancements in battery technology present new opportunities to make V2G technology viable. Using the current and predicted EV technology trends, this paper evaluates the annual operation and benefits of EVs and V2G in a microgrid environment and demonstrates different modes of operation. Guided by the gaps identified in the literature, one of the main contributions of this research is to uncover the impact of EV charging scenarios on the V2G operations. Furthermore, the research reveals the interactions between V2G and variable renewable generation coupled with utility scale battery over yearlong simulations to assess seasonal characteristics of V2G operations, which was mostly unexplored to date. Simulation results indicate that the operation of V2G in an optimised microgrid environment improves the economic operation of the system and reduces the levelized cost of electricity by up to 5.7\%. Additionally, V2G provides more benefit to grids with higher solar generation proportion The results suggest that the latest advancements in EV technology have improved the economic viability of V2G as well as its potential to improve grid efficiency through providing additional storage capacity and peak demand management.},

	abstract = {Curtailment of distributed photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage systems will have significant implications for power system transition around the world. Australia offers a unique case study as it has highest installation rate of distributed-PV and growing fleet of battery energy storage systems. Distributed-PV and battery inverters in Australia are required to exhibit voltage-responsive power-quality response modes to prevent excessive voltage rise caused by increasing day-time energy exports, but these modes can curtail power output and limit the value that can be gained from the renewable energy assets. For the first time in Australia, this paper studies all three inverter power-quality response modes and develops novel algorithms to assess curtailment. The algorithms are applied to a real-world dataset of 1-sec distributed-PV and battery power measurements from 1300 residential households; therefore, data resolution is higher and sample size is larger than previous related studies. Using these datasets, the study compares the experienced curtailment between distributed-PV only sites and distributed-PV coupled with battery sites for the first time. The study investigates and quantifies the energy loss due to curtailment within the South Australia region with over 40\% distributed-PV penetration which has the highest uptake in the world. The results show that average curtailment loss was 1.5\% for distributed-PV only sites and 0.2\% for distributed-PV coupled with battery sites, however, some sites were heavily impacted losing up to 25\% of generation. The reasons for the larger curtailment loss were identified as wiring and network connection faults and high voltage set-points at households' respective local substations. Other potential reason for the heavily impacted sites is being located towards the end of the low voltage feeder, however this couldn't be verified due to lack of spatial data. The large variation in curtailed generation across sites raises concerns for system owners and suggests further inquiry into the power-quality response mode design and regulations. The study also examines inverter conformance using real-world operational data for all three power quality response modes for the first time, and the results showed a low rate of conformance according to the Australian Standards and there were various discrepancies in the execution of these modes which raises concerns considering the increasing importance of distributed-PV and battery inverter fleet in supporting network operations and security. The results therefore warrant further investigation into the reasons behind these discrepancies and devising appropriate mechanisms to tighten inverter conformance checks.},

	abstract = {As distributed photovoltaics (PV) levels increase around the world, it is becoming apparent that the aggregate behavior of many small-scale PV systems during major power system disturbances may pose a significant system security threat if unmanaged. Alternatively, appropriate coordination of these systems might greatly assist in managing such disturbances. A key issue is PV behavior under extreme voltage events. PV connection standards typically specify aspects of inverter voltage behavior. However unresolved questions remain regarding compliance, ambiguity and transition between versions of these standards. In addition, how major voltage disturbances manifest in the low voltage network is complex, and analysis of operational system data could be particularly useful for establishing the behavior of distributed PV in the field. Our study utilizes 30 s operational PV generation data from 376 sites during two major voltage disturbances in Australia. Australia has one of the highest penetrations of distributed PV worldwide, and as such provides a useful case study. Results show that an aggregate {\textasciitilde}30–40\% reduction in distributed PV generation occurred during these events, but individual inverter behavior varied markedly. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time the aggregate response of distributed small-scale PV to voltage disturbances originating in the transmission system has been demonstrated. Four novel techniques for analyzing events are proposed. Results show a potential increase in system security service requirements as distributed PV penetrations grow. Our findings would seem to have major implications for development of composite load models used by power system operators and for contingency management.},

The method is based on a simple moving horizon estimation technique and a 1-D smooth model that can integrate buoyancy effects into a smooth equation. The novelty of the proposed approach is that it is the first state estimation approach that considers both buoyancy and mixing effects. This distinction is paramount to an adequate estimation of the temperature distribution in the storage tank which can then be used for different aims, namely as a basis for model predictive controls. Besides the novel state estimation approach, the paper has three more contributions: (i) it shows how a model for seasonal storage devices can be further extended to smaller stratified tanks with different topologies; (ii) it modifies such a model so that the model equations can be integrated into a single dynamical equation; (iii) it proposes the most complete case study to date for modeling and estimating temperature distribution inside small stratified storage tanks. The analysis of the proposed approach is done in several stages. First, to validate the applicability of the model to small tanks and multiple topologies, we perform a model identification and parameter estimation for three different stratified tanks. Second, we test the accuracy of the proposed state estimation approach in those three stratified tanks employing the estimated parameters in the first experimental study and the models also previously defined. Finally, to further validate the models, we perform a simulation for each of the three tanks and we compare the accuracy of the simulation against real data. As we show, both the state estimation approach and the model are satisfactorily accurate as they display average mean errors below 2 °C.},

	abstract = {The high upfront costs of batteries have limited the investment in retrofit residential energy storage systems for solar customers. Battery size is one of the most important factors that impact the financial return since it determines the major operational capabilities of the solar-coupled storage system. To select the optimal battery size for a photovoltaic solar customer, it is important to perform an analysis taking account of the customer’s on-site generation and consumption characteristics. However, in most cases there are insufficient pre-existing data of the required quality making it difficult to perform such analysis. In this paper, we propose a model that can achieve satisfactory battery sizing results with a limited amount of net meter electricity data. The model uses K-means clustering on customer net meter electricity data to discover important information to extrapolate limited input net/gross meter energy data and uses this in a techno-economic simulation model to determine the optimal battery size. The approach is validated using a set of 262 solar households, two tariff structures (flat and Time-of-Use) and a naive forecasting method as a comparison to the proposed model. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the alternative baseline model and can work with as little as one month of net meter energy data for both of the evaluated tariff structures. On average, the model results in 0.10 normalised root mean squared error in yearly battery savings and net present values, 0.07 normalised root mean squared error in annual electricity costs and a r-squared value of 0.717 in finding the optimal size of batteries. Moreover, this study reveals a linear correlation between the used clustering validity index (Davies-Bouldin Index), and errors in estimated annual battery savings which indicates that this index can be used as a metric for the developed battery sizing approach. With the ongoing rollouts of net meters, the proposed model can address the data shortage issue for both gross and net meter households and assist end users, installers and utilities with their battery sizing analysis.},

The methodology was applied to three countries (Mexico, Costa Rica, and Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)) to show its versatility. Results showed that the annual average energy supplied by a DSWHS-TP (150 L with a collector gross area of 2 m2) in Mexico, Costa Rica, and DRC is 5.27, 4.15, and 4.67 GJ, respectively, which represents a solar fraction of 86.6, 98.9, and 76.1\%. Consequently, annual money savings of 428, 249, and 614 USD, respectively could be realized. The CO2 avoided emissions are affected by the conventional energy source used to heat water. Costa Rica and DRC have an annual average of CO2 avoided emissions per house of 0.049 and 0.006 tons due to the use of electricity produced largely by renewable energy sources compared to Mexico with 0.55 tons of CO2 per house due to the use of the Liquefied Petroleum Gas. Hence, the methodology presented can be an essential tool to establish the benefits of using DSWHS-TP and the avoided emissions of CO2 in the environment.},

We considered both natural gas-powered electric plants and coal-powered plants as the source of the electricity for the heat pumps, the thermal electric storage tanks, and the tankless electric demand heaters. The time-integrated radiative forcing associated with using a heat pump water heater was always smaller than any other means of heating water considered in this study across all time frames including at 20 and 100 years. The estimated amount of CH4 lost during its lifecycle was the most critical factor determining the relative magnitude of the climatic impact. The greatest net climatic benefit within the 20-year time frame was predicted to be achieved when a storage natural gas water heater (the most common system for domestic hot water in the United States) fueled by shale gas was replaced with a high efficiency heat pump water heater powered by coal-generated electricity; the heat pump system powered by renewable electricity would have had an even greater climatic benefit, but was not explicitly modeled in this study. Our analysis provides the first assessment of the GHG footprint associated with using a heat pump water heater, which we demonstrate to be an effective and economically viable way of reducing emissions of GHGs.},

The systems are sized to serve small aggregates of users assumed as micro energy communities in low housing density context in the South of Italy. Electricity storages are also considered to smooth the interaction with the electric grid. Several indices are defined and calculated to guide toward a correct sizing, to check users’ satisfaction and to assess primary energy savings. The results show how the energy consumption from the analysed systems is mainly influenced by the amount and structure of domestic hot water demand per day. Also, according to the chosen plant layouts, it is shown that thermal contribution of PVT slightly influences the system performances. Better results in terms of less non-renewable primary energy consumption are recorded for the PV-based plant. Solar thermal collectors, even if sized for high solar fractions, do not properly support the daily heat pump operation, especially in winter, and present a certain electricity consumption for auxiliaries which results to be penalizing. Additional calculations were performed for the case of energy communities in a context with higher uses of non-renewable energy for electricity generation. Finally, opportunities to support demand-response actions for grid electricity management were investigated.},

	abstract = {An efficient storage retains thermal stratification and improves the discharging performance. Turbulent mixing between hot and cold water is the prime source of stratification destruction. In this paper quantification of turbulent missing was achieved on the basis of temperature profile, MIX number, and Richardson number. The evaluated parameters include flow rate, ΔT, and diffuser design, henceforth a direct interdependence between each was thus established. Various CFD models were developed and experimentally validated on the test rig in order to find the optimal working conditions in discharge mode. The results proved numerically that the tank working conditions can be optimized by proper selection of inlet device. For instance, slotted type inlet device sustained maximum stratification even in as adverse a condition as of turbulent inflow \& low ΔT. Perforated and simple inlet devices were capable of delivering best discharge efficiency only at low flow rate of 200 l/h and were showing insignificant dependency on ΔT. However, as flow rate is increased, ΔT dependency increased. Seeing the compounded benefits of slotted inlet devices and decreased ΔT, it was concluded that slotted inlet device delivered comparatively better thermal performance at both adverse conditions i.e. high flow \& low ΔT and high flow \& high ΔT, however, failed to outshine the rest of the inlet devices at low flow rate \& low ΔT, and low flow rate \& high ΔT. These research findings can serve as guidelines to optimize the storage tank design – more specifically, inlet device based design integrated with heating system, as thermal stratification and COP of heating system – heat pumps, for example, are inherently correlated. Heat pumps are high flow rate and low ΔT devices, while, solar systems are low flow rate and high ΔT devices, Thus, opting for accurate choice of inlet device for a particular operating condition is critical.},

This study considers domestic electric storage water heaters as both thermal storage and controllable loads that respond to electrical network conditions in real-time, participating in demand response (DR) schemes. The studied electrical market leads the world in PV generation at 960 W/capita, and is demonstrating increasingly volatile energy prices and supply quality due to a lack of energy storage and DR. Existing literature in water heater demand management, considers oversimplified water heating models, a tendency to lack real-time financial modelling, and omits a combination of network frequency and DR considerations. This research has proposed a framework of advanced DR value streams for water heaters, leading to advanced water heater design and controls that critically determine the urgency of heating, and intelligently vary the location of thermal energy injection to minimise heat losses and emergency/sanitation heating. The results have demonstrated significant annual financial savings from 113\% to 217\% with DR representing up to 92\% of annual energy consumption. At a national level, a new demand management load of 10.8 GW and 5.94 TWh/annum is identified, representing 2\% of Australia's annual electricity consumption.},

At the same time, it can provide demand management for electricity customers. It is necessary to develop integrated control strategies for aggregated electric loads. Most domestic water heaters (DWHs) are electric and they consume much power especially in winter. DWHs represent a substantial share of the residential electricity consumption. Due to the energy storage capability of DWHs they are the best candidates for load control strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel centralized fuzzy controller for peak shaving of the power demand proﬁles. The proposed centralized controller does not sacriﬁce customers’ convenience level. Simulation results show that the proposed centralized control strategy is effective in shaving the aggregated DWHs load demands while ﬁlling valleys of the aggregated load proﬁle.},

Whereas so far simulation studies are usually done with a simpliﬁed DHW load proﬁle (e.g. according to prEN 12977), a more realistic proﬁle was generated on a 1-min time scale with statistical means. Assumptions about the distribution of the DHW consumption during the year, depending also on the weekday, and the time of the day were made. To study the inﬂuence of the draw-off duration and ﬂow rate as well as the daytime of DHW consumption, TRNSYS simulations were carried out with a variety of simpliﬁed and fairly realistic load proﬁles. In this case study the investigated solar system consists of a storage tank with an internal thermosyphonally driven discharge unit. Despite a rather minor inﬂuence of the draw-off ﬂow rate on the fractional energy savings for the given system applying simpliﬁed proﬁles: a fairly wide range of more than 2 percentage points of the fractional energy savings was found for the system with some constructive improvements or for applying more realistic DHW-proﬁles. It can be concluded that the inﬂuence of the DHW-load proﬁle may not be disregarded, when combistores are compared. This is true especially for stores, for which duration and ﬂow rate of a DHW draw-off have a severe inﬂuence on the temperature stratiﬁcation in the storage tank. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {The heating of domestic hot water (DHW) to supply bathing, cleaning, and appliance needs contributes signiﬁcantly to energy demands in housing. Despite the demonstrated signiﬁcance of DHW draw proﬁles on performance, it is common practice when analyzing solar DHW and solar combisystems to conduct long-term simulations (e.g. annual) using repeating daily proﬁles. New DHW proﬁles that can be used for such analyses have been developed based upon measurements that were taken in 73 houses in Que´bec (Canada). Annual DHW draw proﬁles at a time-resolution of 5 min have been created for 4 consumption levels and 3 temporal consumption patterns (sparing consumers who tend to use DHW in the mornings, average consumers who tend to use DHW in the evenings, etc.). Simulations of a solar DHW system conducted with these new proﬁles revealed that both temporal and annually integrated predictions can be signiﬁcantly aﬀected by timing of DHW draws.},

The beneﬁts of the model are: (1) the on/off state of the water heater and temperature of the water in the tank can be accurately predicted, and (2) it enables the development of water usage proﬁles so that users can be classiﬁed based on usage behaviour. As a result, the amount of ancillary services and peak shaving that can be achieved are accurately predictable and can be maximized without adversely affecting users.},

	abstract = {Former integrated urban energy assessments and optimisation have modelled domestic hot water (DHW) demand as a single stream, as space heating, currently, is the main energy demand in buildings and a detailed DHW modelling was therefore not required. However, the characterisation of energy saving measures (e.g. grey water heat recovery) and the selection of optimal heating utility in buildings with low temperature space heating would beneﬁt from a differentiation of the various DHW end-uses at urban scale (building blocks, streets, districts, city). To this end, a new method characterising the main DHW appliances in households, hotels and nursing homes at urban level, is proposed. A review of European publications characterising water uses is conducted and utility load and energy consumption equations are developed. A speciﬁc model for district heating heat exchangers without thermal storage for integrated urban energy optimisation is proposed. The DHW-related energy consumption results are conﬁrmed by literature values in a real urban case-study. Showering represents more than 80\% of the DHW energy demand, and more than 97\% of the total DHW heat use is required up to 40 °C. The proposed method contributes to urban energy assessments and optimisation by improving the level of detail of the outcomes and by strengthening their integrated approach.},

One of the advantages of the proposed prediction method is that it provides good accuracy without needing large computational resources. Since the method is based on end-use analysis, the EMS can revise the prediction and controls when necessary. The performance of the developed prediction method was evaluated by comparing it with results produced by support vector regression. An operational simulation was performed to evaluate performance in a more practical environment. The simulation indicated that the proposed method showed the best performance.},

	abstract = {In many countries domestic electric hot water storage cylinders have high penetration and account for a large proportion of electricity demand. Their ability to store energy makes them a signiﬁcant opportunity for emerging smart home energy management systems. One approach to evaluating the potential of hot water cylinders under smart control is to simulate electricity demand via a physical model of a cylinder together with assumed hot water usage patterns. Determining the accuracy of these simulations is made diﬃcult by the lack of detailed data on cylinder variables and household hot water usage. This results in simulation methods that potentially miss essential features or are overly complex. To address this issue, we ﬁrst propose a statistical ﬁdelity measure that can be used to compare simulated with monitored electricity demand time series from an individual cylinder. We then present a minimal simulation method that achieves reasonable ﬁdelity with monitored demand. The proposed method is particularly useful for simulating individual households using only electricity time-series data for the purpose of evaluating smart home management scenarios.},

	abstract = {Energy consumption for hot water production is a major draw in high efﬁciency buildings. Optimizing this has typically been approached from a thermodynamics perspective, decoupled from occupant inﬂuence. Furthermore, optimization usually presupposes existence of a detailed dynamics model for the hot water system. These assumptions lead to suboptimal energy efﬁciency in the real world. In this paper, we present a novel reinforcement learning based methodology which optimizes hot water production. The proposed methodology is completely generalizable, and does not require an ofﬂine step or human domain knowledge to build a model for the hot water vessel or the heating element. Occupant preferences too are learnt on the ﬂy. The proposed system is applied to a set of 32 houses in the Netherlands where it reduces energy consumption for hot water production by roughly 20\% with no loss of occupant comfort. Extrapolating, this translates to absolute savings of roughly 200 kWh for a single household on an annual basis. This performance can be replicated to any domestic hot water system and optimization objective, given that the fairly minimal requirements on sensor data are met. With millions of hot water systems operational worldwide, the proposed framework has the potential to reduce energy consumption in existing and new systems on a multi Gigawatt-hour scale in the years to come.},

	abstract = {Increasing energy eﬃciency of thermostatically controlled loads has the potential to substantially reduce domestic energy demand. However, optimizing the eﬃciency of thermostatically controlled loads requires either an existing model or detailed data from sensors to learn it online. Often, neither is practical because of real-world constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that this problem can beneﬁt greatly from multi-agent learning and collaboration. Starting with no thermostatically controlled load speciﬁc information, the multi-agent modelling and control framework is evaluated over an entire year of operation in a large scale pilot in The Netherlands, constituting over 50 houses, resulting in energy savings of almost 200 kW h per household (or 20\% of the energy required for hot water production). Theoretically, these savings can be even higher, a result also validated using simulations. In these experiments, model accuracy in the multi-agent frameworks scales linearly with the number of agents and provides compelling evidence for increased agency as an alternative to additional sensing, domain knowledge or data gathering time. In fact, multi-agent systems can accelerate learning of a thermostatically controlled load’s behaviour by multiple orders of magnitude over single-agent systems, enabling active control faster. These ﬁndings hold even when learning is carried out in a distributed manner to address privacy issues arising from multi-agent cooperation.},

It is in recent years that DHW has emerged as one of the key energy factors in the total energy use in buildings and its share is continuously increasing as energy use in other segments is continuously decreasing, for example space heating, ventilation, and energy for lighting. It becomes suddenly undeniable that efforts in the field of energy-efficient DHW must be strengthened, and as such, there is increased activity in the field. However, the work reported is very dispersed and fragmented. The objective of this review article is to collect and present recent works related to improve performance of a DHW system in terms of energy. The scope and content of the paper aims to address the topics of high relevance to the field, these are shift towards the new situation in which DHW becomes a significant energy use responsible factor in buildings, distribution and weighting of losses related to DHW systems and purpose of DHW use. The article focuses on novel actions to obtain energy-efficient DHW in the following domains: DHW production, DHW distribution and circulation, wastewater heat recovery, and control strategies.

A 3.6 kWp PV system installed on a domestic house with a 315 L storage hot water heater is analysed. It is shown that advanced control of the water heater is critical to make effective use of local intermittent PV power. Without appropriate controls the excess PV power can only reduce the grid energy consumption of an electric storage water heater by approximately 13\%. However, with appropriate control, savings of purchased grid electricity above 80\% can be achieved for electric storage water heaters. Similarly, using a heat pump, the consumption of purchased grid electricity for water heating can be reduced by close to 90\% by making use of excess PV power. The use of excess PV electricity for water heating purposes can also significantly reduce export PV electricity, thereby also assisting the voltage and frequency stabilisation of the electrical distribution network.},

	abstract = {Domestic hot water is a major energy load in current residential buildings. Improving the energy management and efficiency of water heating systems with smart predictive control requires forecasting the domestic hot water consumption. However, accurate prediction models have proven to be difficult to obtain, which is a major barrier to the applicability of predictive control strategies and their ability to reduce the energy consumption. This work optimizes the input parameters and architecture of neural networks to produce prediction models of the future domestic hot water demand. The methodology is tested on domestic water heating systems of various sizes by using data measured in a 40-unit multifamily residential building. The prediction model provides a good performance for the domestic hot water consumption of the entire building (R2 of 0.88). However, for smaller system sizes, the prediction performance is quite variable. This work proposes graphical tools to evaluate the expected predictability of DHW consumption profiles for systems of different sizes and reveals the close relation between the predictability of a given profile and its coefficient of variation.},

	abstract = {Thermally stratified storage tank studies have spanned over 50 years to increase the thermal storage efficiency and accurate prediction of the outlet temperature particularly for solar applications. The studies have reviewed and modeled the jet and plume flow phenomena inside the tank due to the inlet mixing and stratification level. Kelvin–Helmholtz and Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities are the major drivers of the mixing in these tanks. Momentum jets deflecting off walls at the bottom of the tank also create significant mixing. Reviewing Richardson models shows that the categorization was based on the range of Reynolds numbers at the inlet. Unfortunately, the use of superficial velocity in calculating the Richardson number results in critical values in the literature ranging from below 0.25 to 100. The most used length scale associated with these flows is an inertial scale based on the tank height or diameter although the mixing can occur at a relatively smaller scale. The various inlet devices and a large span of flow rates experienced in thermally stratified storage tanks requisite the use of the Reynolds number in combination with a convection number for accurate one dimensional models that predict performance over the long-term. The evaluation of peak shifting of electric loads leveraging renewable sources for applications, including residential hot-water tanks, commercial water tanks, and large-scale chilled water storage tanks, require these models. This paper is focused on establishing the significance of the convection numbers in conjunction with the Reynolds number for modeling the thermal stratification in storage tanks.},

	abstract = {Water heating contributes up to 40\% of a household’s total electricity usage and places a substantial burden on the electricity grid due to high power ratings and users’ largely simultaneous hot water usage. The main determinants of its electricity draw are physical properties such as set temperature, insulation, and plumbing configuration; environmental conditions such as ambient temperature and inlet temperature; and the hot water usage profiles. These profiles include the usage volumes, the times of usage and the outlet temperatures. The efficacy of energy management techniques that model water heaters and the accuracy of their simulation results therefore rely on representative hot water usage profiles. Existing models for household hot water usage neglect differences between users, and temporal variations such as the season and the day of the week, and are not fully autonomous. We propose a probabilistic data-driven model for modelling individualised hot water profiles and an accompanying hot water usage simulator that includes all these factors. We gathered data from 77 residential households over a period of one year to train and evaluate the model for all four seasons. The results show that the simulated hot water usage profiles match the statistical properties of the measured data. Moreover, the individual hot water usage modelling and the resulting aggregated energy load on the grid closely match the measured data, improving on the existing hot water usage by halving the modelling error.},

	abstract = {Solar hot water (SHW) systems are widely used to save energy and reduce CO2 emissions. The domestic hot water (DHW) usage behavior of occupants has a significant influence on the energy consumption of SHW systems; the operation of SHW systems also affects the DHW usage of occupants. However, there is a lack of quantitative analysis for coordinating DHW behavior and the design and operation of SHW systems to maximize solar energy utilization and reduce energy consumption. Therefore, an information-driven stochastic DHW usage model that interacts with SHW systems is proposed. The optimal design and control strategies for SHW systems to match user behaviors were explored. Meanwhile, the effects of occupants’ sensitivity to water temperature and their energy-saving awareness on the energy performance of SHW systems were studied. The results showed that optimal design and control strategies based on the actual DHW profile can increase the annual solar energy utilization rate by 11.5\%, and the corresponding electricity savings, CO2 emission reduction, and cost saving are 163.10 kWh, 145.52 kg, and 81.06 RMB, per household. The location of the reheater had a significant influence on the energy performance and optimal measures of the SHW systems. Moreover, based on technologies or policies to adjust hot water demand, the water supply capacity of SHW systems can be matched with the hot water demand, which can improve the efficiency of solar energy utilization, save 8.5\% of electrical energy for reheating, and lead to a 107.55 kg CO2 reduction and 59.91 RMB cost saving per household per year.},

The purpose of this investigation is to numerically study the impact of the flat plate positions within a vertical storage tank, which operates during the charging mode, on the thermal stratification and to conduct the possible performance enhancements to achieve. CFD numerical comparison between two configurations was carried out and performance parameters such as temperature evolution, Richardson number and stratification number were calculated. It was shown that thermal stratification inside the storage tank is depending on the flat plate’s positions. Thus, increasing flat plates in different positions inside the storage tank does not establish a suitable thermal stratification. Therefore, a superior thermal performance was achieved for the flat plate which is maintained at the middle height of the storage tank. Also, it was found that flat plate’s integration at different angles improves the thermocline structure development.},

Hourly residential use of hot water is often anti-coincident with the peak generation of electricity, presenting an opportunity for reducing consumer costs under dynamic pricing during the afternoon generation peak. We have examined the effects of three strategies on customer costs under dynamic pricing: timed power interruption (long used by certain utilities), a price-sensitive thermostat, and a double period setback timer. Systems which lower the water temperature set points are as economical as power interruption systems, and result in higher minimum water temperature. Our model predicts that a setback thermostat will keep the tank water warmer than a load interruption timer with very similar electricity use. The setback thermostat and the more complex price-sensitive thermostat achieve similar water temperatures and consumer savings.},

	abstract = {Integration of renewable generations with electrical power systems has gained considerable attention in recent years due to environmental and economic benefits. However, this integration introduces additional uncertainties into the existing system and requires appropriate uncertainty modeling for power systems. Typically the uncertainties in power systems are modeled using probabilistic or possibilistic approaches. A combined probabilistic-possibilistic approach is necessary when some uncertain variables are probabilistic and others are possibilistic. This paper presents a complete review of uncertainty categorization and several techniques to address the uncertainty in power systems, along with the merits and weaknesses of each technique. The challenges have been highlighted for future research directions. Analytical and approximate methods are reviewed in this paper when wind power generations are integrated into the existing power grid. Considering the uncertainties of wind power generation and system load demands, the basic probabilistic methods such as Monte-Carlo simulation, cumulant, and 2n+1 point estimation methods are implemented. To explore the capability and shortcoming of these basic methods, a 72-bus equivalent system of Indian southern region power grid is taken into consideration. The results obtained using Monte-Carlo simulation method are treated as a benchmark to analyze the performance of the cumulant and 2n+1 point estimation methods.},

In addition, it is comparable for different power systems and can be used in decision-making by power system operators and planners for future contingency planning and upgrade schemes. The impact of multiple-microgrids is entered in the formulations using the calculation of discrete-time multi-state transition model of the power system in response to an extreme event. The tiN−1me-homogeneous Markov chain is considered to determine the probability of system states (normal, microgrid, and emergency) using the time-independent transition matrix. In order to numerically assess the proposed resilience measure, IEEE 30-bus test case and Iceland 189-bus power system are used and simulations are continued by generating 10000 scenarios considering different event type, severity level and location upon the power system. Finally, Monte Carlo Simulation is used for calculating the resilience metrics.},

	abstract = {Introducing demand side management by adding heat pumps and thermal storage increases self-consumption from domestic PV systems as well as local autonomy of the household. Such effects have been analyzed for different building standards and as a function of storage capacity. Self-consumption levels of 55\% to 65\% from a PV installation of 5.5 kWp can be reached in the case of a 4-person household with medium to low standard of thermal insulation. With respect to a high building standard, additional electrical storage in the form of a 5-kWh Li-ion battery bank is needed to drive the self-consumption level to 50\%. Finally, storage-control algorithms are proposed and simulated that allow a reduction of the peak injection into the grid to as low as 55\% of the nominal peak-output power of the PV system. The original contributions include a quantitative analysis and values for the increase in self-consumption and household autonomy as a function of building standard, the additional impact of battery storage as a function of battery size, as well as the reduction of peak injection by applying smart algorithms for storage control.},

	abstract = {Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), such as refrigerators, air-conditioners and space heaters, offer signiﬁcant potential for short-term modulation of their aggregate power consumption. This ability can be used in principle to provide frequency response services, but controlling a multitude of devices to provide a measured collective response has proven to be challenging. Many controller implementations struggle to manage simultaneously the short-term response and the longterm payback, whereas others rely on a real-time commandand-control infrastructure to resolve this issue. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the control of TCLs that allows for accurate modulation of the aggregate power consumption of a large collection of appliances through stochastic control. By construction, the control scheme is well suited for decentralized implementation, and allows each appliance to enforce strict temperature limits. We also present a particular implementation that results in analytically tractable solutions both for the global response and for the device-level control actions. Computer simulations demonstrate the ability of the controller to modulate the power consumption of a population of heterogeneous appliances according to a reference power proﬁle. Finally, envelope constraints are established for the collective demand response ﬂexibility of a heterogeneous set of TCLs.},

The objective is to optimally schedule the heating cycles of the Domestic Hot Water (DHW) buffer to maximize the selfconsumption of the local photovoltaic (PV) production. A modelbased reinforcement learning technique is used to tackle the underlying sequential decision-making problem. The proposed algorithm learns the stochastic occupant behavior, predicts the PV production and takes into account the dynamics of the system. A real-life experiment with six residential buildings is performed using this algorithm. The results show that the self-consumption of the PV production is signiﬁcantly increased, compared to the default thermostat control.},

	abstract = {In 2002, the UCR time series classification archive was first released with sixteen datasets. It gradually expanded, until 2015 when it increased in size from 45 datasets to 85 datasets. In October 2018 more datasets were added, bringing the total to 128. The new archive contains a wide range of problems, including variable length series, but it still only contains univariate time series classification problems. One of the motivations for introducing the archive was to encourage researchers to perform a more rigorous evaluation of newly proposed time series classification (TSC) algorithms. It has worked: most recent research into TSC uses all 85 datasets to evaluate algorithmic advances. Research into multivariate time series classification, where more than one series are associated with each class label, is in a position where univariate TSC research was a decade ago. Algorithms are evaluated using very few datasets and claims of improvement are not based on statistical comparisons. We aim to address this problem by forming the first iteration of the MTSC archive, to be hosted at the website www.timeseriesclassification.com. Like the univariate archive, this formulation was a collaborative effort between researchers at the University of East Anglia (UEA) and the University of California, Riverside (UCR). The 2018 vintage consists of 30 datasets with a wide range of cases, dimensions and series lengths. For this first iteration of the archive we format all data to be of equal length, include no series with missing data and provide train/test splits.},

	abstract = {Unprecedented changes have occurred over the last five years in the way customers use electricity. These changes are driving electricity distributors to evolve and extend their demand management capabilities to include grid balancing, respond to localised demand and promote and activate smart appliances. In South East Queensland, Australia, two successful forward looking demand management programs are well established. More than 50,000 demand response ready air conditioners have been connected to the network and are able to be controlled by the distributor. Results show that demand reductions from these air conditioners are reliable and sustained for the period of demand events. A second program uses controlled load electric hot water systems as a ‘solar sponge’ to integrate renewables into the network. This article highlights the potential demand management benefits of using hot water systems to reduce the localised peaks and fill the midday demand trough. The results from both programs show the capability of these demand management tools to improve network utilisation and grid balancing and reduce overall network expenditure. A further demand management initiative identified as having the greatest likelihood of success in delivering benefits to both the utility and customer are tariff structures which incorporate cost reflective pricing. In this way, time of use and magnitude of demand are addressed and positive price signals encouraging load control of appliances are provided. This coupling of demand management and tariffs is shown to be highly effective in achieving demand reductions. Automated load control can support customers’ acceptance of new pricing approaches and provide a ‘set and forget’ solution for optimising the benefits of cost reflective tariffs. The challenge for distributors is how to transition the existing demand management incentives and tariffs to a sustainable future program in an increasingly disaggregated and competitive market.},

Shared operation of domestic electrical heating, in such a scenario, may imply changes in everyday heating practices and will change the number of system stakeholders, their activities and how they relate to each other.},

The electric energy demand profile due to these houses are obtained from data collected from a fully monitored sample of ninety houses, in the frame of a two years long experiment reported in previous papers. The SDHWS is designed with the help of software TRNSYS, by using typical meteorological year (TMY) data available for Brazilian capital cities. The TMY data is available at the SWERA database. The TMY data are modified so that the meteorological data profile of any day is used as the forecast data for the day after. The auxiliary energy is supplied to a backup tank in the early hours of the day whenever the solar radiation distribution is expected to have low availability for the solar system. The backup tank volume is optimized in order to get the maximum reduction of the electric energy peak. The paper reports characteristic plots of the frequency of days the energy peak demand in the critical time between 6:00PM and 9:00PM is required, against the energy peak reduction fraction, for different overloads in comparison to a reference fixed load distribution.},

This paper extends ﬁtted Q-iteration, a standard batch RL technique, to the situation when a forecast of the exogenous data is provided. In general, batch RL techniques do not rely on expert knowledge about the system dynamics or the solution. However, if some expert knowledge is provided, it can be incorporated by using the proposed policy adjustment method. Finally, we tackle the challenge of ﬁnding an open-loop schedule required to participate in the day-ahead market. We propose a model-free Monte Carlo method that uses a metric based on the state-action value function or Q-function and we illustrate this method by ﬁnding the day-ahead schedule of a heat-pump thermostat. Our experiments show that batch RL techniques provide a valuable alternative to model-based controllers and that they can be used to construct both closed-loop and open-loop policies.},

	abstract = {In the future due to continued integration of renewable energy sources, demand-side ﬂexibility would be required for managing power grids. Building energy systems will serve as one possible source of energy ﬂexibility. The degree of ﬂexibility provided by building energy systems is highly restricted by power-to-heat conversion such as heat pumps and thermal energy storage possibilities of a building. To quantify building demand ﬂexibility, it is essential to capture the dynamic response of the building energy system with thermal energy storage. To identify the maximum ﬂexibility a building’s energy system can provide, optimal control is required. In this paper, optimal control serves to determine in detail demand ﬂexibility of an oﬃce building equipped with heat pump, electric heater, and thermal energy storage tanks. The demand ﬂexibility is quantiﬁed using diﬀerent performance indicators that suﬃciently characterize ﬂexibility in terms of size (energy), time (power) and costs. To fully describe power ﬂexibility, the paper introduces the instantaneous power ﬂexibility as power ﬂexibility indicator. The instantaneous power ﬂexibility shows the potential power ﬂexibility of TES and power-to-heat in any case of charging, discharging or idle mode. A simulation case study is performed showing that a water tank, a phase change material tank, and a thermochemical material tank integrated with building heating system can be designed to provide ﬂexibility with optimal control.},

The inﬂuence of the time resolution on the distribution of data was analysed by integrating the 6 s data to represent longer logging intervals. Extreme values, especially the high values, are shown to be reduced if the time interval is increased. The maximum household electric power was 50\% higher at a 6 s resolution compared to 60 s and the corresponding difference for domestic hot water ﬂow was 40\%.

On the residential side, domestic electric water heaters (DEWHs) form a signiﬁcant end use class. The ability to accurately estimate and predict the state of individual end use devices allows aggregated control systems to better ensure end-use performance and comfort levels. This paper presents a methodology for estimating and predicting the state of individual DEWHs from models of their thermodynamics and water consumption that are derived under two scenarios: 1) when measurements of both power consumption and water temperature are available; and 2) when only measurements of power consumption are available. The proposed methodology was implemented as part of the PSA pilot project for the DEWH load class to simulate the behavior of the load in presence of the controller and evaluate the performance of the controller. Experimental results show that the model and water usage proﬁle mimic the actual behavior of DEWHs, and can predict the future power consumption when the thermostatic control of a DEWH is interrupted as part of a load control strategy.},

Few on-site measured data and simulation based studies are available to forecast DHW consumption focusing on a daily average, hourly average, appliance consumption, and occupant number. This study derived the hourly DHW proﬁles for 5 different groups of 1 person, 3 people, 10 people, 31 people and more than 50 people as a function of the number of occupants. Weekday (WD), Weekend (WE) and Total day (TD) consumption variation were analyzed. The study accomplished with on-site hourly DHW consumption measurement from 86 apartments with 191 occupants during one year and ﬁndings was also validated against a larger sample from previous study. A speciﬁc selection procedure was developed to ﬁnd out the most representative DHW proﬁle among measured candidates of each group fulﬁlling the selection criteria. Selected proﬁles had similar daily consumption (L/per./day) to an average of all proﬁles and also followed similar consumption pattern during a day. Two sharp peaks with large consumption variance were found in each day and smaller groups had higher consumption during peak hours. Result also found higher evening peak compared to the morning peak and the average consumption of peak hours was 2–4 times higher than non-peaks hours. Morning peaks of WE shifted 2–3 h later from WD’s and kept similar position during the evening. Proﬁles of 5 groups were necessary to normalize with scaling factor to maintain the daily average value. Derived hourly values could be used with monthly factors to deliver hourly proﬁles of all months and the format of hourly and monthly factors used allows to deﬁne DHW consumption in relevant simulation and sizing software.},

	abstract = {The primary objective of this paper is to demonstrate improved energy efﬁciency for domestic hot water (DHW) production in residential buildings. This is done by deriving data-driven optimal heating schedules (used interchangeably with policies) automatically. The optimization leverages actively learnt occupant behaviour and models for thermodynamics of the storage vessel to operate the heating mechanism – an air-source heat pump (ASHP) in this case – at the highest possible efﬁciency. The proposed algorithm, while tested on an ASHP, is essentially decoupled from the heating mechanism making it sufﬁciently robust to generalize to other types of heating mechanisms as well. Simulation results for this optimization based on data from 46 Net-Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) in the Netherlands are presented. These show a reduction of energy consumption for DHW by 20\% using a computationally inexpensive heuristic approach, and 27\% when using a more intensive hybrid ant colony optimization based method. The energy savings are strongly dependent on occupant comfort level. This is demonstrated in real-world settings for a low-consumption house where active control was performed using heuristics for 3.5 months and resulted in energy savings of 27\% (61 kW h). It is straightforward to extend the same models to perform automatic demand side management (ADSM) by treating the DHW vessel as a ﬂexibility bearing device.},

The problem is modeled as a dynamic programming problem, with the state space deﬁned by the temperature of output water, the instantaneous hot water consumption rate, and the estimated grid load. According to simulation, Q-learning and ADHDP reduce the cost of energy consumed by DEWHs by approximately 26\% and 21\%, respectively. The simulation results also indicate that these techniques will minimize the energy consumed during load peak periods. As a result, the customers saved about \$466 and \$367 annually by using Q-learning and ADHDP techniques to control their DEWHs (100 gallons tank size) operation, which is better than the cost reduction that resulted from using the state-of-the-art (\$246) control technique under the same simulation parameters. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work that uses the approximate dynamic programming techniques to solve the DEWH’s load management problem.},

However, load shifting may have some detrimental consequences on the domestic hot water supply temperature if the heating element is deactivated for a long period of time. Furthermore, a new peak may be caused if a significant number of heaters are reactivated at the same time. This study presents a control strategy for water heaters that minimizes the pick-up demand when the heating elements are reactivated at the end of a load shifting period and that ensures, in all cases, the client's hot water supply. The study is based on a simulation model of a water heater that was experimentally validated and takes into account the diversity of the population's hot water withdrawal profile. More specifically, the data of 8,167 real water withdrawal profiles of several clients were input into the simulation model in order to evaluate the performance of water heaters under different operating conditions.},

A model for computation of daily electricity and hot-water demand proﬁles from time-use data was developed, using simple conversion schemes, mean appliance and water-tap data and general daylight availability distributions. Validation against detailed, end-use speciﬁc electricity measurements in a small sample of households reveals that the model for household electricity reproduces hourly load patterns with preservation of important qualitative features. The output from the model, when applied to a large data set of time use in Sweden, also shows correspondence to aggregate proﬁles for both household electricity and hot water from recent Swedish measurement surveys. Deviations on individual household level are predominantly due to occasionally ill-reported time-use data and on aggregate population level due to slightly non-representative samples. Future uses and developments are identiﬁed and it is suggested that modelling energy use from time-use data could be an alternative, or a complement, to energy demand measurements in households.},

This outcome is achieved by applying a hybrid combination of gradient vector ﬁltering, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Dynamic Time Warping Algorithm (DTW) techniques on an existing residential water end-use database of 252 households located in South-east Queensland, Australia having high resolution water meters (0.0139 L/ pulse), remote data transfer loggers (5 s logging) and completed household water appliance audits. The approach enables both single independent events (e.g. shower event) and combined events (i.e. several overlapping single events) to be disaggregated from ﬂow data into a comprehensive end-use event registry. Complex blind source separation of concurrently occurring water end use events (e.g. shower and toilet ﬂush occurring in same time period) is the primary focus of this present study. Validation of the developed model is achieved through an examination of 50 independent combined events.},

This study provides descriptive information on domestic energy usage patterns and investigates the eﬀect of housing type, household characteristics and appliance ownership on electricity energy consumption level. Data were collected via a two-phase self-administered diary survey. Due to Hong Kong’s dense population and sub-tropical climate, energy consumption patterns are distinct from those of other countries. Electricity is the dominant type of energy consumption (63.7\%), followed by Towngas (28.8\%). Energy consumption distribution by end-use appliances and daily energy loading patterns for both electricity and Towngas are reported. Results reveal the inﬂuence of weather and cooking style on energy consumption distribution and the daily energy loading patterns.

	abstract = {In many developing countries due to lack of infrastructure the utilities experience difﬁculties in monitoring their customers’ demand or time of use of electricity and hence it is very difﬁcult to apply DSM (demand-side management) programs for peak shifting. In several of these countries the residential EWHs (electric water heaters) are usually responsible for the evening peak. The general attitude of people is to turn them on just before they need hot water and statistics have shown that this takes place in the evening hours constituting the evening peak. The present work reviews the experimental ﬁndings about the static and dynamic cooling behavior of hot water in storage tanks and discusses the possible timer programs to avoid the peak hours. It is deduced from the experiments that even when the hot water is kept standing in a tank for 12 h after the initial withdrawal of 64.2 L, it would be possible to have warm water at temperatures above 40  C in the top 15\% of the tank to utilize. If the DSM programs are carefully designed it would be possible to set the timers to operate the EWHs for once or twice a day to meet the daily demand of households.},

	abstract = {The rapidly growing world energy use has already raised concerns over supply difﬁculties, exhaustion of energy resources and heavy environmental impacts (ozone layer depletion, global warming, climate change, etc.). The global contribution from buildings towards energy consumption, both residential and commercial, has steadily increased reaching ﬁgures between 20\% and 40\% in developed countries, and has exceeded the other major sectors: industrial and transportation. Growth in population, increasing demand for building services and comfort levels, together with the rise in time spent inside buildings, assure the upward trend in energy demand will continue in the future. For this reason, energy efﬁciency in buildings is today a prime objective for energy policy at regional, national and international levels. Among building services, the growth in HVAC systems energy use is particularly signiﬁcant (50\% of building consumption and 20\% of total consumption in the USA). This paper analyses available information concerning energy consumption in buildings, and particularly related to HVAC systems. Many questions arise: Is the necessary information available? Which are the main building types? What end uses should be considered in the breakdown? Comparisons between different countries are presented specially for commercial buildings. The case of ofﬁces is analysed in deeper detail.},

Domestic space heating load proﬁle for different types of houses have been produced using thermal dynamic model which has been developed using thermal resistant network method. The daily breakdown energy demand load proﬁle of appliance, domestic hot water and space heating can be predicted using this method. The method can produce daily load proﬁle from individual house to urban community. It is suitable to be used at Renewable energy system strategic design stage.},

	abstract = {Appliance level control and automation is an increasingly promising demand-side management tool with growing installation of advanced metering, monitoring and control infrastructure in both residential and commercial contexts. Successful implementation of appliance control and automation can alleviate network peak demand and improve distributed photovoltaic (D-PV) self-consumption to reduce its network voltage and reverse power flow impacts. Domestic electric water heating (DEWH) systems are widely deployed globally and have one of the highest peak power draw and overall energy consumption of household appliances. DEWH storage tanks offer large thermal energy storage capacity which can be used for shifting demand to lower demand periods. With growing D-PV deployment, they also offer the opportunity to store excess generation that would be otherwise exported to the grid. In this work, an intelligent water heating control tool (IWHC) is developed to store excess D-PV generation in DEWH storage tanks as thermal energy, according to the D-PV generation characteristics, household electricity consumption, hot water draw (HWD) patterns, and real time energy monitoring. The IWHC tool was installed and tested in nine Australian households with D-PV and DEWH systems. For performance comparison, two other commercially available control tools, timer, and diverter, were installed and tested in eleven other households with D-PV and DEWH systems. For each control tool, energy simulation models were developed, and the collected field performance data was used to validate the models. The validated simulation models were extended to a broader set of 380 Australian households with a year of D-PV, household and DEWH electricity consumption data. The results indicate that, on average, households can utilize 2.4 kWh, 1.8 kWh and 3.4 kWh of daily excess D-PV generation for water heating, using the IWHC, timer and diverter, respectively. Financial savings from the control of DEWH are highly dependent on households’ tariffs and daily HWD profiles. Under the most optimal morning dominant HWD profile scenario and with an average tariff, households can, on average, save \$100, \$80, and \$170 per year with the IWHC, timer and diverter, respectively. However, the diverter’s superior field performance comes with higher capital cost, making IWHC the most attractive option.},

	abstract = {Water heating is one of the most energy intensive applications in households and domestic electric water heating systems (DEWH) offer large thermal storage for moving electrical load across the day. This study uses a unique dataset from 410 households and presents a comprehensive analysis of electricity consumption and hot water draw of DEWH for the Australian context. Using the real-world data and thermal energy modelling tool TRNSYS, the study analyses the potential of storing and using excess PV generation in DEWH and investigates the impact of different daily hot water draw profiles, PV and DEWH size on the potential for excess PV utilization. The results show that households on average use 6 kWh of energy for DEWH and 142 L of hot water daily. Potential excess PV utilization is highly dependent on the household's daily hot water draw profile and is also affected by seasonality. On average, excess PV generation from a 4.5 kW PV system can provide 48\% of daily DEWH energy for a household with a typical working family profile, which corresponds to a 28\% increase in PV self-consumption.},
